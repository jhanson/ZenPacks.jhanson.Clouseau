     - now works great from buildout
     
     - if it can't save to the save directory (which seems to be buildout default) gives a warning
     
     - copes with local not being there, and added in a sample script there anyway

Feb 2008 [andym]

     - now works with continued lines, with a \ on the end
     
     - escape html in large strings

Sep 2007 [andym]

     - autocomplete in safari now jumps you on to the end of the input field
     
     - up and down now works in safari, was sending two key down events, causing jumps in the history
     
     - input field now gets focus on load
     
     - if you get a tooltip then close it, it will reset, next time you get back to . you'll get the automcomplete code again

Jan 2007 [andym]

    - Fix tab handling in safari, yay!
    
    - Doing an assignment will give you a tooltip too
    
    - Truncate large messages, yay! If a message is large it won't get syntax highlighted, and you can click to expand it. This makes the scrolling much nicer and is neat.

    - Clean up error messages
