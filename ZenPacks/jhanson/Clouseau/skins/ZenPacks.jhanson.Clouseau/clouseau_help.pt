        <p>Clouseau is a Zope and Plone debugger and introspector. It
            allows you to interact with Plone and alter it without being
            encumbered by security restrictions. It provides a Python prompt
            that is connected to the Zope database and contains all the objects
            from your Plone site. This is equivalent to a zopectl or PloneShell
            prompt.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>What about security?</dt>
            <dd>Clouseau is a hole in the standard security model, but not everyone
                considers that a valid model anymore. Certainly it allows a Plone
                user with the Manager role to do anything to your site. But they
                really could anyway. There are few things in the readme.txt that you
                can tweak but at the default setting:
                <ul>
                    <li>Only users with the Plone Manager role can use this</li>
                    <li>If your site is <em>not</em> running in debug mode, Clouseau will
                        be completely inactive and disabled</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>I'm still worried about security</dt>
            <dd>Give it a try on your test sandbox or development site. See how useful
                it is. Then leave it on your development sites, don't put it on your 
                live production sites, that's fine. It's really a <em>development tool</em>.</dd>
            <dt>How do I use it?</dt>
            <dd>Go to the <em>Plone Control Panel</em> and click on Clouseau. This
                will list all the active sessions which you can join or delete. For
                now just create a new session. You'll get a web based Python prompt.</dd>
            <dt>What do I do next?</dt>
            <dd>Type in a Python command for example <code>portal.objectIds()</code> or
                <code>portal.portal_catalog()[:5]</code>. The possiblities are endless, when
                you type these commands you'll see tool tips fly by explaining what things 
                are. Useful eh?
            </dd>

            <dt>Can I delete my plone site with this?</dt>
            <dd>Sure try: <code>app.manage_delObjects(["Plone",]); 
                utils.commit()</code>. Woohoo.</dd>
            <dt>So this is cool, but why do this in the web?</dt>
            <dd>Many developers spend their time in Plone
                so this allows you to access debugging and introspection quickly
                and simply. There a few other neat things:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cross platform, works on everything (including windows)</li>
                    <li>Zero dependencies</li>
                    <li>No ZEO required</li>
                    <li>2 or more people can connect to one session. 
                        Collaborative debugging at it's finest.</li>
                    <li>A context sensitive Plone prompt. When looking at a content 
                        object (eg: front-page) look for the little magnifying glass 
                        in the document actions (just to the right of the print). This
                        will bring you a Python prompt. Try typing <code>context.meta_type</code>
                        </li>
                </ul>
                </dd>
            <dl>
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Extended tooltip support</dt>
                <dd>You'll need DocFinderTab installed for all the details, more useful than a dir.</dd>
                <dt>Up and down</dt>
                <dd>When you are in a prompt, try the <em>up</em> or <em>down</em> arrows
                    to scroll through commands you've written.</dd>
                <dt>What if I change something?</dt>
                <dd>You are in a transaction, so you can commit it once you've done something.
                    We've written a useful little module called <code>utils</code> for that which
                    contains some useful methods <code>utils.commit()</code> and so on. That one
                    command will commit the transaction.
                </dd>
                <dt>Saving sessions</dt>
                <dd>Nothing worse than writing a lot in a session and then losing it, no fear, click
                    the save button to get it onto the filesystem. You can load sessions back from the 
                    filesystem, or directly through the web. Where sessions are saved to is shown
                    on the main Clouseau view.</dd>
